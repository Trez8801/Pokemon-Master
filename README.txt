Within this program you are able to create Pokemon and Pokemon trainers that can battle. The 3 elemental types your pokemon can currently have are fire, water, and grass. 

You can customize your Pokemon's name, level, type, full health, current health, and their "knocked" status. You are also able to customize your Pokemon Trainer by giving them a name, list of active Pokemon at their disposal, how many potions they have, and their currently active Pokemon. 

There is a bit more to the program I plan on adding once I have more time that I feel will really make this project come alive!
